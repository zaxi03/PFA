+ can be done soon:
	- don't expose mysql (port 3306 can be accessed from anyone)
	- who depends on who on docker-compose
	- admin.local dvwa.local not working
	- why use print in python
	- use JiRa
+ to verify:
	- is time format long enough to log bruteforce (if short, very close request maybe seen as duplicate in db. i'm just guessing idk)
+ to discus:
	- waf rules (there are more security related non crs rules)
	- add DOS plugin,...
	- delete phpmyadmin
	
+ In the end:
	- Hide keys and env variables (in code and dockerfile/compose)
	- Hide errors (flask gives very verbose errors)
